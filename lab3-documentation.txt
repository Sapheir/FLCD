My Scanner uses regex to match the different type of content from the source code: int constants, string constants, identifiers, predefined tokens
Comments and whitespaces are skipped by the scanner
There are also regex strings used to find lexical errors, especially for predefined tokens and strings
Int constants, string constants and identifiers that are found by the Scanner are added to their respective hash tables from the Symbol Table and also added to the PIF
